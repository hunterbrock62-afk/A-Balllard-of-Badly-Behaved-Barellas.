Cut to the New Gehenna Police Department blazing with urgency early in the morning. Inside the briefing room, Captain Ariaa stood before a wall-sized map of the Barella mansion. Her grizzled face, carved with years of frustration, tightened as she addressed the room.
“The suspect is tall with a tattoo of a half circle with three pitchforks pointing upwards on his right-hand palm and the same thing but in reverse with the pitchforks pointing down on his left-hand palm,” Capt Ariaa says.
“This is it, people,” she barked, her voice cutting through the buzz of nervous energy. “Augusto Barella has evaded me for too damn long. Today, I bring him in. No slip-ups, no excuses. Today I'm taking down the Storm of New Gehenna.”
Around her, officers shifted uneasily, the gravity of the operation weighing heavy.
“He owns the sky,” muttered a young officer, barely audible.
“Nonsense. Augusto Barella doesn’t own this sky,” Ariaa snapped, slamming her hand on the table.
“We arrested his brother Enno Barella awhile back and cut off his overseas shipment. We obtained more pounds of Diavalo than any of us have ever seen in our lives combined. Now we’ve got the warrants, firepower, and enough backup to turn that mansion into rubble if we have to. He’s done selling Diavalo in this city.” The officers nodded, though doubt lingered in their eyes.
“Suit up. We move in twenty,” she ordered, dismissing the room. As the officers dispersed, Ariaa turned to her deputy, a wiry woman named Sergeant Lena.
“What about the Gautrson family?” she asked.
“They won't be causing us any trouble,” Ariaa says grimly. “The Barellas on the other hand, they won't go down without a fight,” Ariaa says drinking her coffee.
“Make sure everyone knows what they’re walking into. This isn’t a raid—it’s a war.”
Cut to the park in New Gehenna.
The park bustled alive with movement. Children laughing, street performers juggling for spare coins, and the murmur of vendors hawking their goods. Amid the cheerful chaos, a solitary bench sat beneath the sprawling shade of an old oak tree. On that bench, four figures sat, distinctly out of place but blending in just enough to avoid suspicion. The first man on the bench had a tattoo of a chain running along his face. The man leaned forward, elbows on his knees, his sharp eyes fixed on a pair of children playing with a large kite. His lean frame radiated tension as if every muscle in his body was coiled and ready to spring. He ran a hand over his rough face, his weathered knuckles bearing many small scars.
“Kids these days,” the man growled, his voice low and gravelly. “Soft. Give ’em something simple like a kite, and they’re happy for hours. No kind of ambition.”
“They’re not soldiers, Maitri,” the man in the middle said smoothly. He adjusted the cuffs of his finely tailored jacket, his demeanor immaculately calm. Unlike Maitri, the man in the middle exuded an air of refinement, while he physically looked ill, almost dead. Every movement was deliberate and precise. “Relax,” he tells Maitri.
“You relax zombie,” Maitri shot back, his lip curling in disdain. “World would be better off if these kids were put to good use and knew how to fight for what’s theirs.”
The youngest of the group, leaned back against the bench with a smirk, his long legs stretched out lazily. His black leather jacket looked as though it had been stolen from someone wealthier than him—because it likely was. A pair of gold coins danced between his fingers, flipping and twirling with effortless precision.
“Spoken like a man who’s never fought for anything worth keeping,” the youngest quipped, his tone light but cutting. “Discipline can't fill your pockets, Maitri, but a good bluff? Now that’s worth something.”
Maitri’s glare was instant and sharp, but Judas only grinned wider, unfazed.
“Watch yourself, Judas Lokki,” Maitri warned. “Or I’ll show you what discipline feels like.”
“I heard you have a thing for tormenting small children,” Judas shot back.
“Enough,” the gray skinned man in the middle said.
“What's your opinion on children Hapanzi?” Judas instigated, leaning toward her with mock curiosity. Hapanzi, the oldest of the group, sat quietly at the far end of the bench, her wrinkled hands clasping a wooden cane adorned with intricate carvings. Her milky eyes stared into the distance, unseeing but somehow aware. She hummed softly to herself, an old tune that none of the others recognized but all found unsettling. Hapanzi stopped humming, her head tilting slightly toward Judas. For a moment, she said nothing, and the silence stretched long enough to make Judas shift uncomfortably. Then, in a voice cracked with age but laced with eerie clarity, she replied:
“I think they should learn when to shut up,” she said.
Maitri barked a laugh, clapping his hands once. “Finally, someone with sense.”
Judas raised his hands in mock surrender. “Fine, fine. All in good fun. For now.”
The grey skinned man allowed himself a small smirk before his expression turned serious. “Enough of this. We’re not here to debate parenting philosophies. We have a job to do.”
“I don't recall you being our leader or anything, Vortice,” Judas Lokki retorts.
“Be quiet and focus on the mission,” Vortice says. The mention of the job shifted the group’s energy instantly. Maitri straightened, Judas pocketed his coins, and even Hapanzi’s humming stopped.
“The raid,” Maitri said, his voice tinged with anticipation. “What’s the word?”
“Their getting ready now,” Vortice replied, his sharp eyes scanning the park.
Judas chuckled, low and cynical. “Gotta love the cops. Always playing catch-up.”
“And Augusto?” Maitri asked, his hand unconsciously drifting to the knife strapped to his thigh.
“Augusto is mine,” Vortice said coldly, his words brooking no argument.
“Agreed,” Hapanzi said. Maitri’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing.
“What makes you think you get to kill him?” Judas asked, his tone half-joking but his eyes sharp.
“STAND UP AND DO FIFTY CARTWHEELS IN PLACE,” Vortice replied sharply. Judas then gets up and starts doing cartwheels in one spot.
“EVERYONE ELSE IGNORE HIM,” Vortice follows up. Hapanzi and Maitri directed their attention away from Judas as he flipped nonstop.
“I hope you all take Judas as a lesson,” Vortice replied smoothly. “Augusto isn’t some street thug you can knife in the back or con out of a fortune. He’s a storm—a force of nature. You don’t kill a storm by charging into it. You gotta command it. And I’ve been planning this for a very long time.”
Hapanzi chuckled softly, the sound dry and brittle. “You talk too much,” she said.
Vortice ignored her, his focus unbroken. “Stick to the plan, and we’ll all get what we want. Judas is right I'm not your leader but get in the way of my playtime, and you’ll be begging for just fifty cartwheels,” Vortices says while Judas continues to flip in one spot. The three sat in silence for a moment, the weight of his words settling over them. Around them, the park continued its cheerful, oblivious life.
“Fine,” Maitri said his tone grudging. Vortice smiled faintly, his confidence unshaken. “Duly noted.”
“Stop child,” Vortice commanded.
Judas stopped flipping as he stopped and started breathing heavily. Hapanzi began humming again, the eerie tune weaving through the tension like a ghost’s whisper.
“Damn why’d you make me stop, I was at forty-eight?” Judas says still breathing heavily. As the sun dipped lower in the sky, the four assassins rose from the bench, each moving with purpose.
Later on that day, at around 5:00.
Augusto sat at his desk reading a book with only a small dim lamp light illuminating his view, and the room was dark.
“True Ideals of a King. I've read this book six times now, and still, there is this part in the middle I can't comprehend. Something about not allowing our ability to love be blocked by bad thoughts, for if we do then we are standing in our own way.” says Augusto aloud as he continues flipping through the pages.
“Funny, I heard you talked a lot," says Augusto placing down the book. As the silence lingered a strange figure appeared to move behind Augusto. The figure then stood quiet and unmoved.
“I’m the Deus Don, Augusto Maxamillion Ottimo Barella, head of the Barella familia, I don’t talk to my enemies with my back turned,” Augusto says sternly.
The figure steps out of the shadows and around to the front of Augusto's desk. The figure is a tall grey-skinned man.
“I guess the Night shift Syndicate are the ones who hired you. I haven’t had a chit-chat with the bosses in a while, but you know hiring the best of the best assassins to kill your only child tends to make reaching out to or checking in with said persons tedious, to say the least. Wouldn't you agree,” Augusto says facetiously. The man stands firm.
“The child was unauthorized to be-”
“Dante, his name was Dante,” Augusto interrupts whilst checking his side jacket pockets.
“Dante was unauthorized to be to be born. Dons have to follow a different, much stricter set of laws. You knew this, so we were hired to strictly send a message. Now you've fathered six more unauthorized children,” the man says as he pulls a cigar case from his coat and hands Augusto one.
“What is your name?" asked Augusto as he then put the cigar into his mouth.
“Vortice,” speaks the stranger while finally shifting his stance, but not shifting his menacing green eyes off Augusto.
“Vortice, meaning Whirlwind or something like that right? I had a teacher who once told me that names held meaning,” says Augusto as he searches for a lighter. Vortice places his right hand in the air. With two fingers pointing upwards a small light begins to burn the tip of Augusto's cigar. Augusto blows a puff of smoke into Vortices face. 
“Augusto is Greek for Supreme,” Augusto says taking his jacket off and standing up.
“Now that introductions are out the way shall we commence, I've got a dinner to attend to,” says Augusto.
